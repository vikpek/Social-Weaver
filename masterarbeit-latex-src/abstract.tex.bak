Communication through the internet has been made easy in the last few years. But discussing workflows and functionality of web applications or web pages is still a time consuming task, that requires a lot of explanation. Social Weaving introduces a new concept of communication. Injecting - or how we call it: weaving - social elements like chats, wiki pages and so on directly into the view of your application (without the need of modifying the underlying code). Information becomes directly attached to its relevant position. 

This thesis will explain the theory behind Social Weaving and show the prototype Social Weaver.
