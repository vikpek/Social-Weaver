\section{Conclusion}

In the abstract concept level we learned what a Social Weaving system needs to provide and what problems might appear. We defined the requirements and roughly an architecture. Using this knowledge in the second part we described an implementation of a prototype on a more detailed and technical level. This should be seen as a proof of concept that Social Weaving is basically possible.
